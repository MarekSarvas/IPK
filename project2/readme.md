## Description
Programme for sniffing packets implemented in C++ using mainly pcap library. Project is implemented in one file **ipk-sniffer.cpp**
##Submited files
* ipk-sniffer.cpp
* <span>readme.</span>md
* Makefile
* Documentation.pdf

## Run
* compile project using makefile with command *make*, there is a need to run this programme with *sudo* (root privileges) this is include in Makefile, resulting executable file will be **ipk-sniffer**
```bash
make
```
* to run executable you need to run it with sudo command because of capturing packets on different ports e.g.:
```bash
sudo ./ipk-sniffer -i eth0
```
this makes implicit filter as "(proto tcp) or (proto udp)" and it is same as
```bash
sudo ./ipk-sniffer -i eth0 --tcp --udp
```
* there can be added more programme arguments for filtering tcp/udp packets, number of packets or specific port e.g.:
```bash
./ipk-sniffer -i eth0 -p 23 --tcp -n 2
```
all arguments possible are discribed in program help e.g.:
```bash
./ipk-sniffer --help
```
* *ipk-sniffer* executable can be run without *sudo* command in 2 cases
    * ipk-sniffer is  executed without arguments
    * ipk-sniffer is  executed with *--help* argument

## Implementation
* Programme sniffs first n packets set by programme argument(1 default). If flags are set(i.e.: tcp,udp or port number), filter is created and used. Programme runs until n packets are sniffed resolved and printed on stdout.
* Programme is sniffing only tcp or udp packets, when no filter is given "TCP or UDP" is set by default, if user sets interface on which "TCP or UDP" filter is not applicable an error occures and programme ends. Or if interface does not have implemented link-layer type filtering programm ends with return code 1.
* When -i(interface argument) is not used programme prints all devices found by *finalldevs()* function.
* Information about every packet contain timestamp, source ip and port, destination ip and port. If IP can be resolved to FQDN, FQDN is printed instead. Sniffer supports only IPv4 and IPv6 IP to FQDN resolving using DNS cache. IP to FQDN resolving causes small memory leak according to valgrind.
